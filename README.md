### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Chike 
I have a keen interest in data analysis and data science with over two years of experience translating raw data into actionable insights that drive confident decisions. I am at my best creating meaningful metrics, visualizations, statistical models and interactive dashboards.  I just finished my Masters degree in Analytics and Information Management. This degree transformed me from a business major with no code experience to someone who thrives off data and knowing more about it.  I love using data to discover patterns and tell amazing stories with them. It allows me to express my creativity, my critical thinking and my willigness to solve problems.
